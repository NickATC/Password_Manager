# Password Manager
*Version 1.3   May 2019*

Here is a simple, **insecure, not hashed** but effective **Password Manager** built with a nice GUI (?) for a better user experience.  Use this code to learn how to link the database with the GUI.  Database file is full of comments... it was useful for me back then, it may help you!

Since was my second project and my second database, so I didn´t know how to write proper SQL queries.  I think I have improved a lot since then.

Comments and critics are welcome: email me (nicolastautiva.nt      at     gmail dot  com )
